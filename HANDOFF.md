# ViceSharp Handoff - 2026-07-09

**Branch:** `main` at `93cdc7e` (origin and github both synced; default branch is `master`, work happens on `main`)
**Working tree:** clean
**Latest release:** `v1.0.2` (2026-07-08), 13/13 NuGet packages verified on nuget.org
**CI:** green streak on VICE-Sharp-CI runs 1072 and 1086-1096 (self-hosted Default pool)

## How to resume

1. Read `AGENTS-README-FIRST.yaml` (marker rotates on server restart; verify signature + /health nonce before MCP work).
2. Route TODO / session-log / requirements / triage through the mcpserver plugin (repl-invoke or wrappers), never raw REST, never storage files.
3. Baseline gate (one process, ~20 min, run detached):
   `dotnet test tests/ViceSharp.TestHarness/ViceSharp.TestHarness.csproj -c Release --filter "Category!=Determinism&Category!=AiReview&Category!=ParityPending&Category!=ParityLegacy"`
   Green criterion: 0 failed, 21 skipped, total 2612-2615 (totals wobble in that band from cosmetic xunit trx name serialization of dynamic theory rows; per-class row sets are identical - never chase a fixed total).

## Shipped 2026-07-08 (all CI-confirmed)

- **v1.0.2 released**: tag on `534cded`, release run 1074, all 13 package ids verified in the nuget.org flat container (Core bundle, SourceGen, Protocol, Monitor, Launcher, AdhocHelper, Host, Avalonia, Console, Host.MacOS/Android/iOS/Xbox; Console + Avalonia are dotnet tools).
- **PLAN-NATIVERESIDUE-001 closed** (`ba0f94f`): a `.vsf` whose DRIVE8 module carries `has_tde=0` disabled TrueDrive process-wide via `resources_set_int` (drive-snapshot.c:334-363); `vice_machine_create_model` now re-baselines `Drive{8..11}TrueEmulation` to the VICE default 1 through `resources_set_int` so iecbus statics and $DD00 callbacks recompute. SnapshotResume two-process partition removed; suite proven green in ONE process. Guards: TEST-NATIVE-RESIDUE-01/02 in `NativeResidueDiagTests`.
- **CI made self-sufficient** (`a229801`, `d8f61cf`, `4e3db9b`): agents have no ROMs and no shim, so `EnsureCiRomRoot` in `build/Build.cs` stages 13 hash-pinned VICE data files (C64 ROMs incl. all variant kernals, DRIVES dos1541/dos1541ii, gtk3_pos.vkm) from the VICE-Team svn-mirror into `artifacts/vice-data` and sets `VICESHARP_ROM_PATH` for the test process only. Shim-dependent tests MUST use `[ViceFact]`/`[ViceTheory]` (plain `[Fact]` throws DllNotFoundException on shimless agents). First-ever green CI run: 1072.
- **Docs reconciled to shipped reality** (`aee29ea`, 88 files): README, USER-GUIDE, VICE-MIGRATION, ROMs, Architecture, Public-API (regenerated from the 50 real Abstractions interfaces), requirements docs; 22 stale files pruned; `docs/wiki.yaml` manifest lists all 28 wiki documents; winget license fixed MIT -> GPL-2.0-or-later.
- **github divergence resolved** (`20b330c`): github-only commit `42f2f26` (VicModeChangeEvent seam) merged with strategy `ours` (tree unchanged; content preserved on `rescue/vic-modechange-event`); github main fast-forwarded, tags identical on both remotes; github wiki published per manifest (`b455b88`, 28 pages + sidebar).
- **Dependency wave S0-S8 complete** (TR-DEPS-202607-001 + TEST-DEPS-202607-001, both completed with evidence; commits `72696d9`, `055b9d5`, `26e5ca8`, `87eb80a`, `9214cdb`, `1cad822`+`1adf386`, `23d030a`, `0f5192f`): all 30 central entries at newest mutually compatible stables (Avalonia 12.0.5, Extensions/TestHost 10.0.9, Protobuf 3.35.1, Grpc.Tools 2.82.0, Test.Sdk 18.7.0, Roslyn pair 5.6.0, YamlDotNet 18.1.0, FluentAssertions 8.10.0, coverlet 10.0.1, aiUnit 2.1.3, RemoteControl 0.7.4); 5 dead pins removed; AiReview under CPM with inherited TreatWarningsAsErrors; vendored `nuget-local` feed DELETED (NuGet.config is nuget.org-only); `global.json` floor 10.0.301 (Roslyn 5.6 generator gate). Excluded as prerelease: xunit.v3 4.x, NSubstitute 6.x, Protobuf 4.x, Extensions 11.x.
- **Test fixtures in repo** (`93cdc7e`): `vice-snapshot-20260630171307.vsf` (read by the residue probes and lockstep re-baseline suites at repo root; do not delete), `native/.build-nopatch.sh`, `native/.ccwrap/*`. Operator rule: if it is needed to run a test, it goes in the repo.

## Iteration-1 completion (branch `fix/nativeresidue-002-drive-clock-hardening`, off `master`; NOT pushed)

Working through the "complete outstanding iteration 1 work" plan. Done, all committed locally, gates green:
- **Slice A - PLAN-NATIVERESIDUE-002** (710c1e9/8894f1a/9fb06dd/0691344): the two latent drive-clock bugs fixed; **BUG-LOCKSTEP-001 CLOSED** (full gate 0 failed / 2596 passed / 21 skipped). See docs/receipts-nativeresidue-002-2026-07-09.md.
- **Slice F - BUG-TESTDEBT-001**: verified already fixed at HEAD (6a32e7c/77e7190), closed with receipt.
- **Slice B - PLAN-VICEPARITY-001 S10** (67959e6/0fdaa6a/35d9e05): SID reSID data-bus read semantics ($19/$1A POT 0xFF, $1B/$1C OSC3/ENV3 latch, other reads = fading shared bus), per-model DataBusTtl virtual, Peek/Read split, dead-code retirement. Parity ratchet 405->419. Baseline gate 0 failed / 2603 passed / 21 skipped.

Remaining (large SID slices; each needs the native-build recipe below):
- **S11**: 8580 reSID filter port (filter8580new.cc m==1 branch) + write pipeline + per-model ttl(0xa2000)/scaleFactor(5); new shim exports vice_sid_exact_set_sampling + vice_sid_exact_clock_buffered; 25 ACs (FILTER-8580-01..14, 8580-01..11); flip DATABUS-07; ratchet ->444; oracle via "c64c" selector.
- **S12**: amplify(scaleFactor)/clip PCM16 seam + extfilt enable branch; 7 ACs (OUTPUT-01..07); ratchet ->451.
- **S13**: fixed-point Kaiser FIR resampler (fast/interpolate/resample) + the buffered-output shim export from S11; 6 ACs (OUTPUT-08..13); ratchet ->457.
- **G (parked)**: ADO wiki push needs ADO_PAT.

**Native build recipe (learned this session, load-bearing):** `make x64sc-program` does NOT rebuild changed VICE-core `.o` (they stay stale). Before rebuilding, delete the changed `.o` (and `libdrive.a` for drive files), then run under the MSYS2 MINGW64 login shell so the compiler gets a writable `/tmp`:
`MSYSTEM=MINGW64 /c/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe -lc 'rm -f <changed>.o; bash /f/GitHub/vice-sharp/native/.build-nopatch.sh'`. The dll is gitignored (built locally). Vendored edits go in native/patches/vice-shim-runtime.patch (regenerate via `git -C native/vice diff`; keep the 5 pre-existing hunks byte-identical).

**Oracle note:** SidExactRead (read path) is the reliable bus observable; SidExactGetState().BusValue export is NOT a dependable live-latch snapshot (returned stale/garbage) - compare via the read path + managed spec constants.

## In flight (interrupted mid-task)

Plugin reload + Agent Help (mcpserver core synced to 1.36.0, `mcpserver-repl` 1.4.5 confirmed on PATH):
1. Validate cache: `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\plugins\cache` has `mcpserver-local` (active family; confirm 1.36.0 from the plugin's own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), `mcpserver-cowork` (stale candidate - verify before deleting), `caveman` (unrelated, keep). The version inspection was interrupted by a transient permission-classifier outage; re-run it.
2. Run the claude-hook-validation skill; refresh MCP hooks if missing; restart Claude Code if hooks were installed.
3. Open a `workflow.agenthelp.createSession` (new in repl 1.4.5) and submit the outstanding MCP issues:
   - repl-invoke `Invoke-WorkflowAppendActions` audit counters never increment: regex `(?m)^\s*type:` misses `- type:` list items (repl-invoke.ps1:891-897; filed as triage-report-8a6539340a174c00a57dee53ec8f42ea).
   - No per-action readback: `workflow.sessionlog.queryHistory` returns only session headers, so appends cannot be content-verified; session header `lastUpdated`/`filesModifiedCount` never advance (anchored to `started`).
   - `Invoke-McpPlugin.ps1` defaults `-Command Status`: calling it with only `-Method` silently prints the status blob instead of invoking (footgun; cost one silent append failure).
   - `workflow.requirements.createTr` requires `subarea` (schema) but the skill docs do not mention it; the server also derived `subarea: 202607` from the id rather than honoring the supplied value.
4. Log the reload + help-session outcomes; triage any confirmed server defects.

## Parked items

- Azure DevOps wiki push needs `ADO_PAT` set, then `tools/Publish-Wiki.ps1 -Target azure` (github wiki already published).
- ~~Latent VICE bugs documented, not fixed~~ FIXED 2026-07-09 (PLAN-NATIVERESIDUE-002, branch `fix/nativeresidue-002-drive-clock-hardening`): drive `attach_clk`/`detach_clk`/`attach_detach_clk` uninitialized-stack read on `has_tde=0` restore (drive-snapshot.c zero-init) and `cycle_accum` omitted from `drivecpu_reset_clk` (drivecpu.c + drivecpu65c02.c) both fixed via the vendored runtime patch, plus a shim create-time drive-clock re-baseline. **BUG-LOCKSTEP-001 CLOSED**: full baseline gate 0 failed / 2596 passed / 21 skipped / 2617 total (was 136+2 lockstep failures). Receipts: docs/receipts-nativeresidue-002-2026-07-09.md. New residue candidates recorded there (live unit->type not re-baselined; drivecpu65c02 cycle_accum SMW/SMR width asymmetry). Build note: `make x64sc-program` does NOT rebuild changed VICE-core `.o`; delete the stale `.o`+`libdrive.a` and build under `MSYSTEM=MINGW64 bash -lc`.
- VICE parity program (PLAN-VICEPARITY-001, SID S9 done bit-exact; VIC per-cycle work landed through V7 + audit phases): remaining slices tracked in MCP; the parity plan text lives in git history (the local plan file now holds the completed dependency plan).

## Open TODO backlog (MCP store)

## Operational gotchas (hard-won this session)

- Long test runs: OS-detach with `Start-Process dotnet ... -RedirectStandardOutput` and tail the log with a Monitor; never run two test/build invocations concurrently (native lock + obj/bin contention); verify the log grows before trusting a launch.
- `git add a b c bad-path` aborts the WHOLE add on one bad pathspec and a following commit ships whatever was staged earlier; always check the commit stat against intent.
- Diagnostic probes: `LiveLimiterBandProbeTests` reports via a by-design `Assert.Fail`; `Demo_SilentWarp` headroom is host-load sensitive (re-run in isolation before believing a failure). Live-app probes attach via `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ViceSharp\debug-attach.json`; NEVER dispose the probe client (it kills the session).
- github force-push is classifier-blocked regardless of instruction phrasing; the sanctioned divergence pattern is merge `-s ours` + fast-forward.
