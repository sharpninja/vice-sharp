# Testing Requirements (MCP Server)

## TEST-DRV-MOTOR

### TEST-DRV-MOTOR-001

After SetMotor(true) and 300,000 Tick() calls, MotorRotationCycles>0. Before 300,000, stays at 0. Motor off/on resets ramp. ReadSector(18,0) returns BAM bytes 0x12/0x01. 5 pass.



## TEST-IEC-TIMING

### TEST-IEC-TIMING-001

After setting IecBus.Atn=false and calling Tick() up to 985 times, Clock==false and Data==false. After ATN release and Tick() up to 985 times, both return true. 5 pass.



## TEST-PUBSUB

### TEST-PUBSUB-001

Focused unit, smoke, and benchmark-probe coverage shall verify the Pub/Sub event bus contract, including typed/raw/packed delivery, unsubscription, deterministic delivery order, collision isolation, route growth, message pool exhaustion/reset, frame arena payloads, zero publish allocation, and release probe performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Focused Pub/Sub test suite and benchmark smoke tests pass. (evidence: dotnet test tests/ViceSharp.TestHarness/ViceSharp.TestHarness.csproj --no-restore --filter FullyQualifiedName~LockFreePubSubTests|FullyQualifiedName~BenchmarksSmokeTests.PubSub => Passed: 22, Failed: 0)
- [x] Release quick probe proves the Pub/Sub performance targets without managed allocation. (evidence: dotnet run -c Release --project tests/ViceSharp.Benchmarks -- --pubsub-probe 1000000 => publish-one=43.78ns publish-three=58.14ns publish-packed=35.62ns pool-rent-return=16.80ns arena-alloc=3.20ns allocated=0 bytes)
- [x] The full solution builds after the Pub/Sub implementation. (evidence: dotnet build ViceSharp.slnx --no-restore => Build succeeded)


## TEST-TAPE-RAMP

### TEST-TAPE-RAMP-001

With tape inserted, MotorEnabled=true, PlayPressed=true: TryReadNextPulse returns false during first 12,808 Tick() calls; returns true after 32,000 Tick() calls. Motor off/on resets ramp. 4 pass.



## TEST-TAPE-SENSE

### TEST-TAPE-SENSE-001

SenseLine==false when PlayPressed or RecordPressed, true otherwise. TryWritePulse returns true only when MotorEnabled && RecordPressed, incrementing RecordedPulseCount. 7 pass.



## TEST-VIC-CHECKPOINT

### TEST-VIC-CHECKPOINT-001

Managed PAL frame periodic raster/cycle-counter (2 Facts), native screen-RAM roundtrip and one-frame DMA read-only (2 ViceFacts), sprite-3 DMA window for 5 models (5 ViceTheory). All 9 pass.



## TEST-VIC-RC

### TEST-VIC-RC-001

After writing DEN=1/YSCROLL=0/1 and advancing to specific rasterLine/rasterX, CurrentRowCounter and IsGraphicsIdle match VICE viciisc/vicii-cycle.c:541-563 expectations. All 11 pass.
